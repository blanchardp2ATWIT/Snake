	-MJEP

Q2: Team membersâ€™ names
	-Jorge
	-Mason
	-Enrique
	-Patrick

Q3: What is the problem you plan to solve?
	-Create a snake game

Q4:What is the idea to solve the problem?
	- Create a javafx Scene
	- Random place the apple 
	- check for apple and snake collision
	- Update score, among other things. Anytime something is updated in the code that needs to be reflected in the gui the scene must be updated in java fx.
	- We will use aspects of object oriented programming to manipulate objects in the game. For example 
and apple class that detects if the position of the snake is the same as the position of the apple. If so, snake gets bigger another apple "spawns" and the apple that is ate disappears.

	-Inherance 
	-polymorphism
	-Ecapsulation
	-Abastarct 

Q6: What tools will the team use to work on it?
	- The team plans on working with the jetbrains intelij IDE, this was because javafx is easier to download and use on this ide rather than eclispe which proves to keep having issues. 
	- Although it has not been discussed we could possibly use GIT to keep track of progress. 
	- We are using discord as a means of communication.

Q7: What is your schedule of the project?
	- Right now our schedule is when we all have time to meet. We all are under heavy work load so we are in constant communication for when would be the best time to sit and work on this. 
	- There will be planned meetings during the week to sit and work on this.
